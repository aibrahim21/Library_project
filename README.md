# Library_project
This project is a simple book management interface using JavaScript. It involves creating a Book object using a function constructor, where each book has name, price, and an author (also an object created using a separate constructor with name and email properties).

The user is prompted to enter the number of books they want to add. A validated form is used to input the data for each book, which is then stored in an array of book objects.

Once all the books are entered, a table displays each bookâ€™s information with Edit and Delete buttons:

Edit: Makes the row editable so the user can update the book's details, with options to Save or Cancel changes.

Delete: Removes the book from the array and deletes the corresponding row from the table.

This project demonstrates basic JavaScript object-oriented programming, DOM manipulation, form validation, and dynamic UI interaction.
